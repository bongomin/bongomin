### Hi, I am Bongomin Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack Software Engneer. I can provide clean code and pixel perfect design. I do not shy away from challenges in my field of work and as a result I have learned a lot and amassed numerous skills and problem solving techniques over the years. I am always looking to improve my craft and keep up with the fast evolving nature of the IT industry.
